## Image Classification using Hugging Face and Custom Model

### Overview
This project aims to classify images into predefined categories using the Hugging Face library and a custom computer vision model named "blib".

### Problem Statement
Given an image, accurately classify it into one of several predefined classes.

### Methodology
1. Load the pre-trained "blib" model.
2. Preprocess the image using Hugging Face's image processing tools.
3. Pass the preprocessed image through the "blib" model.
4. Obtain classification results.

### Usage
To run the code:
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install huggingface transformers
